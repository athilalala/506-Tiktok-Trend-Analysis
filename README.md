# 506-Tiktok-Trend-Analysis
**1. Project Description**
   This project focuses on understanding and predicting TikTok video virality using a multimodal data science approach. We plan to combine Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze captions, titles,      and hashtags, along with Computer Vision methods to study the visual content of videos. We’ll also look at early engagement signals like initial views, likes, and comments. By bringing these different aspects       together, the goal is to identify what factors most strongly influence virality and see whether combining them leads to better prediction performance.

**2. Project Goals**
   Succesfully predict whether a Tiktok video will preform better than average using its caption text, hashtags, visual content, and early engagement metrics within the first 24–72 hours after posting while
   extracting visual features from video frames through computer vision techniques to evaluate their contribution to virality prediction.

**3. Data Collection Plan**
   Potential Data Sources:
    
    Public TikTok datasets from platforms such as Kaggle and HuggingFace containing captions, hashtags, engagement metrics, and video metadata.
   
   Data Collection Method:
     
     Primary data will be obtained from publicly available datasets.
     If additional data is required, publicly accessible TikTok content will be collected using ethical scraping tools to obtain captions, engagement metrics, and video links.
